☐ multiple attribute folders with same name when multiple files have same attribute.

☑ Read won't work!! The return value is somehow discarded.

☑ DO SOMETHING ABOUT RÄTTIGHETERNA PÅ KATALOGERNA FFS~~!!! OMG !!11
    ☐ Snygga till det hela, gör enhetligt osv.

☑ Crashes when moving from a value dir to a value dir.

☐ Giving a key to a file with the same name as the file does not produce an attribute folder with the name of the file. In other words: fix some system that checks for duplicate file names and such.


☐ When loading entries from the data base, the attribute folders return bogus stats.
☐ Adding two key folders in Nautilus or Konqueror and moving files to first one and then the other leads to the other having the name "unnamed"!
