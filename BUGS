☐ Giving a key to a file with the same name as the file does not produce an attribute folder with the name of the file. In other words: fix some system that checks for duplicate file names and such.


☐ When loading entries from the data base, the attribute folders return bogus stats.
☐ Adding two key folders in Nautilus or Konqueror and moving files to first one and then the other leads to the other having the name "unnamed"‽
