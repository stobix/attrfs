Make it possible to copy files between folders. (Which will mostly be the same as changing attributes for files.)
    Copy or only link?
Make a real app of the main app.

Include support for "deep attributes":
    % attr -s "Foo/Bar" -V "Etaoin,Shrdlu" Baz
    =>
    % ls attribs/Foo/Bar -R
    Etaoin/Baz
    Shrdlu/Baz


Apparently, linux calls open before calling setattr. What to do with open?
