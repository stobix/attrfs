Make it possible to copy files between folders. (Which will mostly be the same as changing attributes for files.)
    Copy or only link?

Make the app terminate when fusermount -u mountdir
make empty attribute dirs dissapear on file system unmount

include support for mkdir, rmdir, move and others to change attributes.

include support for reading files!

make closedir do something useful.

Include support for "deep attributes":
    % attr -s "Foo/Bar" -V "Etaoin,Shrdlu" Baz
    =>
    % ls attribs/Foo/Bar -R
    Etaoin/Baz
    Shrdlu/Baz

make setxattr unset old attribute value folders when adding new ones.

make the dir functions context sensitive.
make all applicable functions context sensitive.
use CTX as an index for accessing attributes?
have different attribute folders for different users? different groups? different users or group according to mode?

change attribute_dir into #attribute_dir{keyparent,value}, where keyparent is nil for main key attribute dirs.

Add support for value-less key-value attribute pairs? makes attribs/Foo/file possible.

Apparently, linux calls open before calling setattr. What to do with open?
