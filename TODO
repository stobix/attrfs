☐ Make it possible to copy files between folders. (Which will mostly be the same as changing attributes for files.)

☐ Make the app terminate when fusermount -u mountdir

include support for 
    ☑ mkdir, 
    ☑ rmdir, 
    ☑ rename 
    ☐ and others? to change attributes.
    ☐ link


☐ Add support for moving real files in the real file system by moving files in the real part of the file system. Change names of database entries simultaneously.

☐ Include support for creating files! Nautilus wants to have a .Trash and a .thumbnails directory...    
 ☐  files
 ☐  folders
    
☐ Include support for writing to files
 ☐  mirrored
 ☐  created

☑ include support for reading files!

☑ make closedir do something useful.

☑ Include support for "multi-valued attributes":
    % attr -s "Foo" -V "Etaoin,Shrdlu" Baz.file
    =>
    % ls attribs/Foo -R
    Etaoin/Baz.file
    Shrdlu/Baz.file
  Setting multi-valued arguments now fixed.
  Getting multi-valued arguments fixed.

☑ Fix the FUSE "feature" of not letting me access a/b/c/a, where a and a are the same directory.

☐ Include support for "deep attributes":
  ☑  % attr -s "Foo/Bar" -V "Etaoin" Baz.file
    =>
    % ls attribs/Foo/Bar/Etaoin -R
    Baz.file

    % attr -s "Bla" -V "" Baz
    =>
    % ls attribs/Bla
    Baz

  ☐ Make logical dirs ignore directories when filtering.

☐ Add support for value-less key-value attribute pairs? makes attribs/Foo/file possible.
    % attr -s "Foo" -V "" Bar.file
    =>
    % ls attribs/Foo 
    Bar.file
    ☐ Change Key, {Key,Value} into {Key,nil},{Key,Value}, {{Key,Value},Value},...


☐ Include support for setting multiple attributes at once:
    % attr -s "Foo,Bar" -V "Etaoin" Baz.file
    =>
    % ls attribs -R
    Foo/Etaoin/Baz.file
    Bar/Etaoin/Baz.file

☐ The above combined:
    % attr -s "Foo/Bar" -V "Etaoin,Shrdlu" Baz.file
    =>
    % ls attribs/Foo/Bar -R
    Etaoin/Baz.file
    Shrdlu/Baz.file

☐ Include support for search directories:
    ☐ Special directories 
        ☑ AND, OR, BUTNOT, 
        ☐ NOT which negates the next folder choise
        ☐ AND<key folder> , BUTNOT <key folder> etc for every value folder.
        ☐ parentheses, to be able to do a/b OR (c/d AND e/f) and such
        
        % ls attribs/Foo/Bar
            Etaoin
            Shrdlu
            AND
            ...
        % ls attribs/Foo/Baz
            Blah
            Shrdlu
            AND
            ...
        % ls attribs/Foo/Baz/AND/Foo/Bar
            Shrdlu
            AND
            ...

    ☐ A new root directory tree for "search dirs" with special syntax:
        ☐ (Foo/Bar & Foo/Baz) | (Etaoin/(Shrdlu & Foo)|Blah/*)
        ☐ Regex?

☐ make one able to remove attribute key directories

☐ make setxattr unset old attribute value folders when adding new ones.

☐ make the dir functions context sensitive.
    different users shown different context, different users have different rights...
☐ make all applicable functions context sensitive.
☐ have different attribute folders for different users? different groups? different users or group according to mode?
☐ Use CTX as an index for accessing attributes?

☐ check if the OS tries to copy a file unto itself (from a real dir to an attribute dir). 
  This copying is to be "ignored", that is, regarded as a rename operation, which is the same as hard linking, also for dirs. Touching or movin the file should be regarded as the same as copying in this FS.


☐ Make a way to "reload" the directory we're mirroring from.
☐ Support mirroring from multiple directories.
☐ Detect duplicates in the folder(s) to mirror.
  * note as folders under /duplicates ?
    /duplicates/foo.file/paths.txt or something like it.
  * show duplicate files as a special type of folder?


☑ Apparently, linux calls open before calling setattr. What to do with open? Assign fh.


☐ what is wrong with the logical subdirs? Do I point sequentially all the way down to the original, or do I point directly to the original from all?
