This is the style I've choosen for this project:

Indentation: 
  2 spaces for each indentation level.
  end brackets at the same level as beginning brackets.
  case/if/etc and end on the same indentation level.

Spaces beetween words:
  As few as possible!
  Spaces around arrows, " -> "
  No other spaces around operators, unless neccessary. (Around "or" but not around "+").

  Primarily use the style
    Bla=
      case ...
      end
  and not
    Bla=case
    end


Function calls broken over several lines have the end parenthesis at the same indentation level as the function.
  FunFoo(...
    ...
  )

funs have matchings on same indentation level:
  fun({A}) ->...
     (B) -> ...
  end
  

case clauses broken over several lines:

  case some
    long
    case
    condition of
    ...
  end
